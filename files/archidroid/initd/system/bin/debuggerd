# DON'T REMOVE THIS FILE
# ArchiDroid's Init.d contains two parts - a /system/etc/init.d/00ARCHIDROID_INITD init.d script, and this hook
# This file is the core of ArchiDroid's Init.d
#
# Debuggerd hook always waits for kernel and other init.d callers, and if nobody cares then it executes all init.d scripts
# Therefore, it's a very safe method for having reliable init.d call, without modyfing the kernel's ramdisk

# You may want to customize below options to your preferences

# Delay in seconds, which specifies the amount of time we need to wait for the kernel or other init.d callers
# This is required in order to don't execute all init.d scripts twice
# A 5 seconds should be the safe value and more than enough - if something is going to execute init.d, it should start within 5 seconds from boot
# You can also specify "0" here for no delay and insta-call, but beware that all your init.d scripts probably will be executed twice - by kernel and this hook
DELAY=5

# This value specifies if you want to call all scripts in the background or not
# In general it's a good idea to call them in the background, change this to "false" only if you require strict-order of your scripts
BACKGROUND=1

# Don't change values below unless you know what you're doing
